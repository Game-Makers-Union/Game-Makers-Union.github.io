                        philosophies,
                        creativity, and a desire to create immersive experiences for all to enjoy are the core key
                        pillars here at GMU.

                    <p>
                        GMU has two main missions:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Teach students game development skills (Total beginners welcome!).</li>
                        <li>Create one incredible game per year with our student-led team!
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have weekly meetings which run in
                        <a href="https://www.torontomu.ca/the-catalyst/">
                            <u style="color: skyblue">The Catalyst (Rogers Communication Centre, 2nd Floor)</u></a>.
                        This is a creative, open space where collaboration, innovation, and motivation thrive in a
                        variety of ways!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In terms of student learning, we run weekly tutorials covering a variety of topics, each of
                        which thoroughly contribute to the interdisciplinary nature of game design. From how to pitch a
                        game to a plethora of game design paradigms (Mechanics, Levels, Models & more!), each tutorial
                        delivers valuable insights & actionable foresight! We also use this space to welcome guests
                        across the video game industry, which give presentations, connecting students and establish
                        concrete networking opportunities!
