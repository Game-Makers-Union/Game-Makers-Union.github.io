Whether handled personally or through delegation to our capable team of execs, I ensure that we meet student group regulations and funding requirements, that we always have a space to meet and work. I connect with industry guests and bring them in to talk to students, I collaborate with TMU organizations and outside sponsors to improve students' experience. I ensure that our development team has everything they need to create the best game possible to showcase the full extent of their skills. It's an immense job, but nothing can match the joy I get from seeing students thrive in this community we've created.",
