                                        Tired after a long shift at work, you rest your head in the break room while
                                        waiting for the bus. When you wake up, you find out that you've overslept:
                                        the store is now closed, and you are <b>"alone"</b>...
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Surely it's as simple as walking out the main entrance, right? If this isn't
                                        the case, you may need to find a second way out of the store. But, there's
                                        no reason you'd need to do this, and there's certainly no reason the manager
                                        would still be in the store with you...

                                        'The Lot' is an atmospheric walking simulator set in an eerie underground
                                        parking lot. The game is a subtle take on horror and is deeply inspired by
                                        the concept of liminality. It takes place in an infinite loop, and as such
                                        there is no finite ending. Each level of the parking lot is slightly
                                        different to the last.
